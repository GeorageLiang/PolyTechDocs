# 1A Theatre Square

<blockquote>
<p>Theatre Square in the capital city of Berland has a rectangular shape with the size n × m meters. On the occasion of the city's anniversary, a decision was taken to pave the Square with square granite flagstones. Each flagstone is of the size a × a.</p>

<p>What is the least number of flagstones needed to pave the Square? It's allowed to cover the surface larger than the Theatre Square, but the Square has to be covered. It's not allowed to break the flagstones. The sides of flagstones should be parallel to the sides of the Square.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The input contains three positive integer numbers in the first line: n,  m and a (1 ≤  n, m, a ≤ 10**9).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Write the needed number of flagstones.<br>
</blockquote>

####Sample test(s):

```bash
input

output
4
```

####Code:

```python
import sys
import math
#读取输入并将所输入的内容按照空格进行切片分割成数组
inputs = sys.stdin.readline().split()
#分别获取n,m和a的值，并且转换为int类型
n = int(inputs[0])
m = int(inputs[1])
a = int(inputs[2])
#math.ceil函数表示向上取整
#因为n和a都是整数，所以如果直接使用除法，则得到的是舍去小数的整数部分
#所以需要先将其转换为浮点数
x = math.ceil(n * 1.0 / a)
y = math.ceil(m * 1.0 / a)
print int(x*y)

# 4A Watermelon

<blockquote>
<p>One hot summer day Pete and his friend Billy decided to buy a watermelon. They chose the biggest and the ripest one, in their opinion. After that the watermelon was weighed, and the scales showed w kilos. They rushed home, dying of thirst, and decided to divide the berry, however they faced a hard problem.</p>

<p>Pete and Billy are great fans of even numbers, that's why they want to divide the watermelon in such a way that each of the two parts weighs even number of kilos, at the same time it is not obligatory that the parts are equal. The boys are extremely tired and want to start their meal as soon as possible, that's why you should help them and find out, if they can divide the watermelon in the way they want. For sure, each of them should get a part of positive weight.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first (and the only) input line contains integer number w (1 ≤ w ≤ 100) — the weight of the watermelon bought by the boys.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print YES, if the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts, each of them weighing even number of kilos; and NO in the opposite case.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
For example, the boys can divide the watermelon into two parts of 2 and 6 kilos respectively (another variant — two parts of 4 and 4 kilos).
</blockquote>

####Sample test(s):

```bash
input
8
output
YES
```

####Code:

```python
#这道题实际上就是来判断一个数是否可以分成2个偶数
#因为偶数+偶数一定是一个偶数，所以任意奇数都一定不可分
#另外偶数为2只能分成1和1，故如果w为2也返回NO
import sys
w = int(sys.stdin.readline())
if w % 2 == 1 or w == 2: print "NO"
else: print "YES"
```

# 158A Next Round

<blockquote>
<p>"Contestant who earns a score equal to or greater than the k-th place finisher's score will advance to the next round, as long as the contestant earns a positive score..." — an excerpt from contest rules.</p>

<p>A total of n participants took part in the contest (n ≥ k), and you already know their scores. Calculate how many participants will advance to the next round.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 50) separated by a single space.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100), where ai is the score earned by the participant who got the i-th place. The given sequence is non-increasing (that is, for all i from 1 to n - 1 the following condition is fulfilled: ai ≥ ai + 1).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Output the number of participants who advance to the next round.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
In the first example the participant on the 5th place earned 7 points. As the participant on the 6th place also earned 7 points, there are 6 advancers.

In the second example nobody got a positive score.

# 71A Way Too Long Words

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes some words like "localization" or "internationalization" are so long that writing them many times in one text is quite tiresome.</p>

<p>Let's consider a word too long, if its length is strictly more than 10 characters. All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.</p>

<p>This abbreviation is made like this: we write down the first and the last letter of a word and between them we write the number of letters between the first and the last letters. That number is in decimal system and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.</p>

<p>Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and "internationalization» will be spelt as "i18n".</p>

<p>You are suggested to automatize the process of changing the words with abbreviations. At that all too long words should be replaced by the abbreviation and the words that are not too long should not undergo any changes.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each of the following n lines contains one word. All the words consist of lowercase Latin letters and possess the lengths of from 1 to 100 characters.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print n lines. The i-th line should contain the result of replacing of the i-th word from the input data.

# 118A String Task

<blockquote>
<p>Petya started to attend programming lessons. On the first lesson his task was to write a simple program. The program was supposed to do the following: in the given string, consisting if uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, it:</p>
* deletes all the vowels,<br>
* inserts a character "." before each consonant,<br>
* replaces all uppercase consonants with corresponding lowercase ones.<br>
<p>Vowels are letters "A", "O", "Y", "E", "U", "I", and the rest are consonants. The program's input is exactly one string, it should return the output as a single string, resulting after the program's processing the initial string.</p>
<p>Help Petya cope with this easy task.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line represents input string of Petya's program. This string only consists of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and its length is from 1 to 100, inclusive.

# 158B Taxi

<blockquote>
<p>After the lessons n groups of schoolchildren went outside and decided to visit Polycarpus to celebrate his birthday. We know that the i-th group consists of si friends (1 ≤ si ≤ 4), and they want to go to Polycarpus together. They decided to get there by taxi. Each car can carry at most four passengers. What minimum number of cars will the children need if all members of each group should ride in the same taxi (but one taxi can take more than one group)?</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10**5) — the number of groups of schoolchildren. The second line contains a sequence of integers s1, s2, ..., sn (1 ≤ si ≤ 4). The integers are separated by a space, si is the number of children in the i-th group.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print the single number — the minimum number of taxis necessary to drive all children to Polycarpus.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
<p>In the first test we can sort the children into four cars like this:</p>
* the third group (consisting of four children),<br>
* the fourth group (consisting of three children),<br>
* the fifth group (consisting of three children),<br>

# 50A Domino piling

<blockquote>
<p>You are given a rectangular board of M × N squares. Also you are given an unlimited number of standard domino pieces of 2 × 1 squares. You are allowed to rotate the pieces. You are asked to place as many dominoes as possible on the board so as to meet the following conditions:</p>

1. Each domino completely covers two squares.<br>
2. No two dominoes overlap.<br>
3. Each domino lies entirely inside the board. It is allowed to touch the edges of the board.<br>

<p>Find the maximum number of dominoes, which can be placed under these restrictions.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
In a single line you are given two integers M and N — board sizes in squares (1 ≤ M ≤ N ≤ 16).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Output one number — the maximal number of dominoes, which can be placed.

# 116A Tram

<blockquote>
<p>Linear Kingdom has exactly one tram line. It has n stops, numbered from 1 to n in the order of tram's movement. At the i-th stop ai passengers exit the tram, while bi passengers enter it. The tram is empty before it arrives at the first stop. Also, when the tram arrives at the last stop, all passengers exit so that it becomes empty.</p>

<p>Your task is to calculate the tram's minimum capacity such that the number of people inside the tram at any time never exceeds this capacity. Note that at each stop all exiting passengers exit before any entering passenger enters the tram.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains a single number n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of the tram's stops.<br>

<p>Then n lines follow, each contains two integers ai and bi (0 ≤ ai, bi ≤ 1000) — the number of passengers that exits the tram at the i-th stop, and the number of passengers that enter the tram at the i-th stop. The stops are given from the first to the last stop in the order of tram's movement.</p>

* The number of people who exit at a given stop does not exceed the total number of people in the tram immediately before it arrives at the stop. More formally, <img src="http://espresso.codeforces.com/eb1e20fd58cc4373d8f42eb7e743d3ea232d1a19.png"/>. This particularly means that a1 = 0.<br>
* At the last stop, all the passengers exit the tram and it becomes empty. More formally, <img src="http://espresso.codeforces.com/8cbe43ecd252bf7d670f9a3956cbe50263d2f09b.png"/><br>
* No passenger will enter the train at the last stop. That is, bn = 0.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print a single integer denoting the minimum possible capacity of the tram (0 is allowed).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
For the first example, a capacity of 6 is sufficient:
<br>
<br>
* At the first stop, the number of passengers inside the tram before arriving is 0. Then, 3 passengers enter the tram, and the number of passengers inside the tram becomes 3.<br>
* At the second stop, 2 passengers exit the tram (1 passenger remains inside). Then, 5 passengers enter the tram. There are 6 passengers inside the tram now.<br>
* At the third stop, 4 passengers exit the tram (2 passengers remain inside). Then, 2 passengers enter the tram. There are 4 passengers inside the tram now.<br>
* Finally, all the remaining passengers inside the tram exit the tram at the last stop. There are no passenger inside the tram now, which is in line with the constraints.<br>
<p>Since the number of passengers inside the tram never exceeds 6, a capacity of 6 is sufficient. Furthermore it is not possible for the tram to have a capacity less than 6. Hence, 6 is the correct answer.</p>

# 231A Team

<blockquote>
<p>One day three best friends Petya, Vasya and Tonya decided to form a team and take part in programming contests. Participants are usually offered several problems during programming contests. Long before the start the friends decided that they will implement a problem if at least two of them are sure about the solution. Otherwise, the friends won't write the problem's solution.</p>

<p>This contest offers n problems to the participants. For each problem we know, which friend is sure about the solution. Help the friends find the number of problems for which they will write a solution.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first input line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of problems in the contest. Then n lines contain three integers each, each integer is either 0 or 1. If the first number in the line equals 1, then Petya is sure about the problem's solution, otherwise he isn't sure. The second number shows Vasya's view on the solution, the third number shows Tonya's view. The numbers on the lines are separated by spaces.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print a single integer — the number of problems the friends will implement on the contest.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
In the first sample Petya and Vasya are sure that they know how to solve the first problem and all three of them know how to solve the second problem. That means that they will write solutions for these problems. Only Petya is sure about the solution for the third problem, but that isn't enough, so the friends won't take it.
<br>
<p>In the second sample the friends will only implement the second problem, as Vasya and Tonya are sure about the solution.</p>

# 82A Double Cola

<blockquote>
<p>Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, Rajesh and Howard are in the queue for a "Double Cola" drink vending machine; there are no other people in the queue. The first one in the queue (Sheldon) buys a can, drinks it and doubles! The resulting two Sheldons go to the end of the queue. Then the next in the queue (Leonard) buys a can, drinks it and gets to the end of the queue as two Leonards, and so on. This process continues ad infinitum.</p>

<p>For example, Penny drinks the third can of cola and the queue will look like this: Rajesh, Howard, Sheldon, Sheldon, Leonard, Leonard, Penny, Penny.</p>

<p>Write a program that will print the name of a man who will drink the n-th can.</p>

<p>Note that in the very beginning the queue looks like that: Sheldon, Leonard, Penny, Rajesh, Howard. The first person is Sheldon.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The input data consist of a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10**9).
<br>
<p>It is guaranteed that the pretests check the spelling of all the five names, that is, that they contain all the five possible answers.</p>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print the single line — the name of the person who drinks the n-th can of cola. The cans are numbered starting from 1. Please note that you should spell the names like this: "Sheldon", "Leonard", "Penny", "Rajesh", "Howard" (without the quotes). In that order precisely the friends are in the queue initially.
