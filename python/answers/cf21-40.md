  <h5>关于Sample Test样式的问题</h5>
  <p>目前我是直接用的pygments bash类型来对test进行处理，实际上我觉得input和output如果能带上颜色，那么会更直观一些。</p>
  <p>如果有人对<a href="http://pygments.org/" target=_blank>Hacking For Pygments</a>感兴趣，可以试着增加对input和output的过滤识别并上色，或者也可以试着尝试一下pygments支持的哪种语言可以对其上色。</p>

# 110A Nearly Lucky Number

<blockquote>
<p>Petya loves lucky numbers. We all know that lucky numbers are the positive integers whose decimal representations contain only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all numbers are lucky. Petya calls a number nearly lucky if the number of lucky digits in it is a lucky number. He wonders whether number n is a nearly lucky number.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The only line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10**18).

Please do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit numbers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specificator.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print on the single line "YES" if n is a nearly lucky number. Otherwise, print "NO" (without the quotes).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
In the first sample there are 3 lucky digits (first one and last two), so the answer is "NO".<br>
In the second sample there are 7 lucky digits, 7 is lucky number, so the answer is "YES".<br>
In the third sample there are no lucky digits, so the answer is "NO".
</blockquote>

output
NO

input
7747774
output
YES

input
1000000000000000000

#实际上就是统计出现4或者7的位数的个数是否为4或7
import sys
number = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
flag = True
#用n来记录出现4或者7的个数
n = 0
for i in range(len(number)):
	digit = number[i]
	if digit in "47":
		n += 1
if str(n) in "47":
	print "YES"
else:
	print "NO"
```

# 236A Boy or Girl

<blockquote>
<p>Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.</p>

<p>But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user names.</p>

<p>This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters — the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.

<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes).
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
For the first example. There are 6 distinct characters in "wjmzbmr". These characters are: "w", "j", "m", "z", "b", "r". So wjmzbmr is a female and you should print "CHAT WITH HER!".
</blockquote>

####Sample test(s):

```bash
input
wjmzbmr
output
CHAT WITH HER!

input
xiaodao
output
IGNORE HIM!

input
sevenkplus
output
CHAT WITH HER!
```

####Code:

```python
#统计输入的名字不重复的字母有多少个
#如果是偶数个，则输出"CHAT WITH HER!"
#如果是基数个，则输出"IGNORE HIM!"
import sys
inputs = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
distinctN = ""
for i in range(len(inputs)):
	char = inputs[i]
	if char not in distinctN:
		distinctN = distinctN + char
if len(distinctN) % 2 == 0:
	print "CHAT WITH HER!"
else:
	print "IGNORE HIM!"
```

<p>Note, that during capitalization all the letters except the first one remains unchanged.</p>
<strong>Input</strong><br>
A single line contains a non-empty word. This word consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters. The length of the word will not exceed 103.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Output the given word after capitalization.

# 339A Helpful Maths

<blockquote>
<p>Xenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.</p>

<p>The teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2 and 3. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+3.</p>

<p>You've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains a non-empty string s — the sum Xenia needs to count. String s contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters "+". Besides, string s is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2 and 3. String s is at most 100 characters long.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print the new sum that Xenia can count.

# 144A Arrival of the General

<blockquote>
<p>A Ministry for Defense sent a general to inspect the Super Secret Military Squad under the command of the Colonel SuperDuper. Having learned the news, the colonel ordered to all n squad soldiers to line up on the parade ground.</p>

<p>By the military charter the soldiers should stand in the order of non-increasing of their height. But as there's virtually no time to do that, the soldiers lined up in the arbitrary order. However, the general is rather short-sighted and he thinks that the soldiers lined up correctly if the first soldier in the line has the maximum height and the last soldier has the minimum height. Please note that the way other solders are positioned does not matter, including the case when there are several soldiers whose height is maximum or minimum. Only the heights of the first and the last soldier are important.</p>

<p>For example, the general considers the sequence of heights (4, 3, 4, 2, 1, 1) correct and the sequence (4, 3, 1, 2, 2) wrong.</p>

<p>Within one second the colonel can swap any two neighboring soldiers. Help him count the minimum time needed to form a line-up which the general will consider correct.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first input line contains the only integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) which represents the number of soldiers in the line. The second line contains integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 100) the values of the soldiers' heights in the order of soldiers' heights' increasing in the order from the beginning of the line to its end. The numbers are space-separated. Numbers a1, a2, ..., an are not necessarily different.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print the only integer — the minimum number of seconds the colonel will need to form a line-up the general will like.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
In the first sample the colonel will need to swap the first and second soldier and then the third and fourth soldier. That will take 2 seconds. The resulting position of the soldiers is (44, 33, 22, 11).
<br><br>
In the second sample the colonel may swap the soldiers in the following sequence:
<br><br>
(10, 10, 58, 31, 63, 40, 76)<br>
(10, 58, 10, 31, 63, 40, 76)<br>
(10, 58, 10, 31, 63, 76, 40)<br>

# 266B Queue at the School

<blockquote>
<p>During the break the schoolchildren, boys and girls, formed a queue of n people in the canteen. Initially the children stood in the order they entered the canteen. However, after a while the boys started feeling awkward for standing in front of the girls in the queue and they started letting the girls move forward each second.</p>

<p>Let's describe the process more precisely. Let's say that the positions in the queue are sequentially numbered by integers from 1 to n, at that the person in the position number 1 is served first. Then, if at time x a boy stands on the i-th position and a girl stands on the (i + 1)-th position, then at time x + 1 the i-th position will have a girl and the (i + 1)-th position will have a boy. The time is given in seconds.</p>

<p>You've got the initial position of the children, at the initial moment of time. Determine the way the queue is going to look after t seconds.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains two integers n and t (1 ≤ n, t ≤ 50), which represent the number of children in the queue and the time after which the queue will transform into the arrangement you need to find.
<br><br>
The next line contains string s, which represents the schoolchildren's initial arrangement. If the i-th position in the queue contains a boy, then the i-th character of string s equals "B", otherwise the i-th character equals "G".
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print string a, which describes the arrangement after t seconds. If the i-th position has a boy after the needed time, then the i-th character a must equal "B", otherwise it must equal "G".

# 136A Presents

<blockquote>
<p>Little Petya very much likes gifts. Recently he has received a new laptop as a New Year gift from his mother. He immediately decided to give it to somebody else as what can be more pleasant than giving somebody gifts. And on this occasion he organized a New Year party at his place and invited n his friends there.</p>

<p>If there's one thing Petya likes more that receiving gifts, that's watching others giving gifts to somebody else. Thus, he safely hid the laptop until the next New Year and made up his mind to watch his friends exchanging gifts while he does not participate in the process. He numbered all his friends with integers from 1 to n. Petya remembered that a friend number i gave a gift to a friend number pi. He also remembered that each of his friends received exactly one gift.</p>

<p>Now Petya wants to know for each friend i the number of a friend who has given him a gift.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the quantity of friends Petya invited to the party. The second line contains n space-separated integers: the i-th number is pi — the number of a friend who gave a gift to friend number i. It is guaranteed that each friend received exactly one gift. It is possible that some friends do not share Petya's ideas of giving gifts to somebody else. Those friends gave the gifts to themselves.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
Print n space-separated integers: the i-th number should equal the number of the friend who gave a gift to friend number i.

# 268A Games

<blockquote>
<p>Manao works on a sports TV. He's spent much time watching the football games of some country. After a while he began to notice different patterns. For example, each team has two sets of uniforms: home uniform and guest uniform. When a team plays a game at home, the players put on the home uniform. When a team plays as a guest on somebody else's stadium, the players put on the guest uniform. The only exception to that rule is: when the home uniform color of the host team matches the guests' uniform, the host team puts on its guest uniform as well. For each team the color of the home and guest uniform is different.</p>

<p>There are n teams taking part in the national championship. The championship consists of n·(n - 1) games: each team invites each other team to its stadium. At this point Manao wondered: how many times during the championship is a host team going to put on the guest uniform? Note that the order of the games does not affect this number.</p>

<p>You know the colors of the home and guest uniform for each team. For simplicity, the colors are numbered by integers in such a way that no two distinct colors have the same number. Help Manao find the answer to his question.</p>

<strong>Input</strong><br>
The first line contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 30). Each of the following n lines contains a pair of distinct space-separated integers hi, ai (1 ≤ hi, ai ≤ 100) — the colors of the i-th team's home and guest uniforms, respectively.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Output</strong><br>
In a single line print the number of games where the host team is going to play in the guest uniform.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong><br>
In the first test case the championship consists of 6 games. The only game with the event in question is the game between teams 2 and 1 on the stadium of team 2.
<br><br>
In the second test sample the host team will have to wear guest uniform in the games between teams: 1 and 2, 2 and 1, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, 4 and 2 (the host team is written first).

Let's index the matrix rows by numbers from 1 to 5 from top to bottom, let's index the matrix columns by numbers from 1 to 5 from left to right. In one move, you are allowed to apply one of the two following transformations to the matrix:</p>

1. Swap two neighboring matrix rows, that is, rows with indexes i and i + 1 for some integer i (1 ≤ i < 5).<br>
2. Swap two neighboring matrix columns, that is, columns with indexes j and j + 1 for some integer j (1 ≤ j < 5).

<p>You think that a matrix looks beautiful, if the single number one of the matrix is located in its middle (in the cell that is on the intersection of the third row and the third column). Count the minimum number of moves needed to make the matrix beautiful.</p>
<strong>Input</strong><br>
The input consists of five lines, each line contains five integers: the j-th integer in the i-th line of the input represents the element of the matrix that is located on the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column.
